284,"Suellen was in bed when I arrived today. I helped her get dresses for breakfast and then we checked the activity schedule. Suellen has an appointment scheduled with the hair salon today and there is a scenic drive today that we hope we can go on.
At breakfast Suellen ate 100% of her meal. We took a small walk before returning to her room. Suellen was more agitated today than I‚Äôve seen in a while. She did not want to sit down for long at all and kept telling me we had to go that it was time and if I could help her she was constantly grabbing my hands trying to get me to help her and go. I tried music and dancing around the room for redirection distractions but it only lasted a few minutes.
At lunch Suellen was not hungry. She only ate maybe 20% of her meal but she did eat her chocolate ice cream.
There was an outing at 1pm that I thought Suellen would enjoy but when we returned to her room Suellen layed down and was fast asleep for over an hour. After Suellen woke up we went for a very long walk around the facility and talked to a few friends. On our way back to her room we did stop at the little cafe and got a cookie to enjoy for later. When we got back to her room Suellen was much the same as earlier and could not sit still. Was grabbing me and asking for help. We walked around as much as possible but she just seemed so confused and a little scared today.
At dinner Suellen was fairly hungry and ate 80% of her meal tonight. She engaged with me over dinner and then we said good night to everyone and came back to her room. Then changed into pajamas brushed our teeth then Suellen layed down for bed. Suellen was snoozing away by 630.
Before leaving today I let everyone know and left suellens room open so caregivers could check in on her if needed. "

I drove to Legendary Doughnuts for Cory, 0.3 miles there and 0.3 miles back.

Cory ate meatballs and rice at 2:30pm, saved the rest for later.

1300cc of urine, emptied at 3:20pm. Small amount of blood and sediment in it.

Cory has a couple cuts on his right inner thigh. Minimal blood on his pads. I put some medicine on it and changed out the pad. His rash seems to be getting better with the new anti fungal medicine Cory received.
